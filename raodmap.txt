Roadmap:

Main Idea:
- Open Link
- Ask for the user's location
- Ask the user for the desired radius for bathroom search
- Get our database of bathroom locations
- Cross-reference bathroom locations with the user's location and find closest bathrooms in the desired radius
- When the user selects a location have it pop in some way like google maps where it zooms in and shows the location,
  an option to press go, and shows reviews
- When the user presses the go to button it gives them the fastest directions to get there.
- Asks the user for an options survey/review

Secondary Idea (option to add a bathroom):
- If user wants to add a bathroom there is a button they can press
- If pressed it asks for the location (address), where the bathroom is (like which building), a picture of the bathroom doors
  to verify there is a bathroom there
- Once verified it adds the bathroom location to a database

Third Idea (option to report a bathroom): 
- If user selects this option it ask for a reason why it was reported
- The report is looked at by a member of the dev team
- If the report is deemed true and significant the bathroom is either flagged or removed
